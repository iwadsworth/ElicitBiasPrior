# ElicitBiasPrior
A Shiny app for the elicitation of prior opinion for the external biases, in a specific example in the context of epilepsy clinical trials.

The file 'app_function.R' contains the Shiny app function (named 'elicit_func'). Calling this function will run the app. An overview of the context and running of the app can be found in file 'guide.pdf'. A more detailed overview of the statistical methodology and purpose of the app will be found in Wadsworth et al. (2020).
